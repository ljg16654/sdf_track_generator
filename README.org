This little project generates [[http://sdformat.org/][sdf]] files for tracks given arbitrary
alignment of cones. The models are provided by [[https://github.com/eufsa/eufs_sim][EUFS simulation]].

* input poses format

Each line of =input_poses= should be 6 float numbers separated by
spaces.
The 6 floats specify the Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) and Euler angles
of the cones. Normally the cones are placed on a horizontal plane, so
the last four are 0's.

* usage:

#+begin_src sh

mkdir -p build
make -k
python3 gen_pose.py
echo "<?xml version='1.0'?>" > custom_track.sdf
build/mod_cone_pose input_poses model_single_cone.sdf >> custom_track.sdf 

#+end_src

Currently =input_poses= contains random numbers which do not make any
sense. Hopefully =gen_pose.py= will soon be replaced by something that
involves slightly more sophisticated algorithms.
